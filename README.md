  ## Description
  This social media API allows users to create users, create thoughts, react to other thoughts, add friends and more. The purpose of creating this application was to create a fully functioning API that utilized MongoDB and Mongoose. It was a very rewarding experience as I learned a lot and continue to grow my skills with databases.

  ## Installation
  Clone the repository onto your local machine. Open the file in your preferred code editor. First, open an integrated terminal and type npm i to install all dependencies. Once dependencies are installed, type npm start to initialize the server. You then can open your server up inside of insomnia to test your routes.
    
  ## Usage
 Once you have started the server you can open a POST request and type in http://localhost:3001/api/users/. Select the body tag and select JSON. From here, you can start by creating some users to seed your database like so. 

 {
    "username": "She-Hulk",
    "email": "she-hulk@email.com"
 }

 Once you type in the user you want to create, click send and it will return the user that you created. 

 If you would like a demonstration of how to call each route, a link to a demonstration video is below.
